Also I'll assume that we count the number of element comparisons (since comparing $$$l, r$$$ is not memory intensive, so it is not that important anyway). If we also count comparisons of $$$l, r$$$, it is twice of what we are counting here, minus 1, so it won't end up changing the ratio at all.</p><p>Firstly note that we can assume that the underlying array is $$$1, \\ldots, n$$$ (since we can compress elements, and for the sake of simplicity we can assume that the array consists of distinct elements). I suspect that the result should remain the same even when there are duplicate elements.</p><p>Let $$$a(l, r, q)$$$ be the expected number of element comparisons this algorithm does when you have a query $$$q$$$ in an interval $$$[l, r]$$$.</p><p>Then note that $$$a(l, r, q) = a(1, r - l + 1, q - l + 1)$$$.</p><p>Using this, if $$$b(n, q) = a(1, n, q)$$$, we can get a recurrence: $$$b(n, q) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{q - 1} b(n - i, q - i) + \\sum_{i = q}^{n - 1} b(i, q)$$$.</p><p>We want $$$c(n) = \\mathbb{E}_q[b(n, q)] = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{q = 1}^n b(n, q)$$$, and the recurrence on summing for $$$q = 1$$$ to $$$n$$$ becomes $$$c(n) = 1 + \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i c(i)}{n(n - 1)/2}$$$.</p><p>Let $$$d(n) := n c(n) + 1$$$. We then have $$$d(n)/n - d(n - 1)/(n - 1) = \\frac{2n - 1}{n(n + 1)}$$$.</p><p>So we have $$$c(n) = 2H_n - 2$$$.

Applying several operations of type $$$G$$$ to an array is equivalent to applying some permutation to the codomain $$$\\{1 \\ldots k\\}$$$ of the array. Since these operations are invertible, and we need to count equivalence classes with respect to this operation, it makes sense to try <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma\">Burnside's lemma</a>.

So, the formula further reduces to</p> <center>$$$ \\displaystyle A_n = \\frac{1}{k!} \\sum_{i=0}^k \\binom{k}{i} \\cdot D_{k-i} \\cdot i^n. $$$</center><p>Counting derangements is easy and well-known, so this formula allows direct calculation of $$$A_i$$$ in $$$O(k \\log{i})$$$.

So, we can consider the function $$$h(t) = \\sum_{j=0}^k g_j(t) = \\sum_{j=0}^k \\frac{(g_1(t))^j}{j!}$$$ and calculate its coefficients. There is obviously not enough time to evaluate all terms of this sum; we will have to cancel most of them out and then undo this.

Feel free to check the revision history if you'd like to see the original version :)</p><p>In short, I downvoted because my contest was wrecked by a tight time limit on D1D. I'll discuss some other criticisms afterwards, but this was really the main issue I have with the round--i.e., I would not have downvoted if not for the tight TL, and I think the round was otherwise no worse than the usual CF round, and even somewhat better than the average round in a few ways. Similarly, I don't view this as an explanation for the mass downvotes--I can understand people who were personally affected by constant factor TLEs or FSTs downvoting, since it's easy to see how those can ruin the round for the people they affect, but I don't understand or agree with the downvotes from competitors who didn't run into those issues. </p><p>I had to spend the last half-hour or so of my contest trying various constant factor optimizations to get my solution to D to pass; meanwhile, many others were able to get AC far more easily using various methods of cheese (e.g. bitsets, randomized approaches, etc). For context, when I benchmarked my solution, the main bottleneck was $$$O(n 2^m)$$$, with the constant factor from a policy-based hash map. It was surprising to me that a solution involving $$$3.2 \\cdot 10^6$$$ hashmap operations TLE'd, and given that this is the same complexity as the intended solution (and, at least in theory, a better complexity than the bitmask solution), I would argue that the TL was overly tight and should have been somewhat higher. </p><p>I found this particularly frustrating because it meant that I spent the vast majority of my contest code-monkeying rather than thinking about the problems. This was partly my fault: I vastly overcomplicated the implementation of C and previously incorrectly asserted that the problem was essentially an implementation bash; it turns out that the problem is actually quite nice overall. However, excluding C, I spent at most 10-15 minutes thinking of solutions and around seventy minutes implementing, around half of which involved optimizing my D to get it to fit within the TL. In contrast, if not for the TL issue with D, I would have been able to spend the last half-hour of the contest thinking about E (which seemed like a very interesting problem!), which would have made the experience much more satisfying. (Incidentally, this sort of thing is one argument in support of fewer problems--I think deleting D from the set and changing the TL on C could have made for a pretty satisfying five-problem Div. 1 round, although the gap between C and E is a bit large.)</p><p>Otherwise, I have three criticisms of the contest:</p> <ol>   <li><p>Some others have reported TL issues with C; my $$$O(n \\log^2 n)$$$ solution passed with around 150ms to spare, but others have constructed $$$O(n \\log^2 n)$$$ solutions that TLE. I think it would be remarkably hard to cut all $$$O(n \\log^2 n)$$$ solutions without creating constant factor TLEs among $$$O(n \\log n)$$$, so my suggestion would be to increase the TL (perhaps to 2.5s) to admit more $$$O(n \\log^2 n)$$$ implementations. That said, I think increasing the bound on $$$n$$$ to $$$300,000$$$ and reducing the time limit to one second in an attempt to admit only $$$O(n \\log n)$$$ solutions would also be a reasonable choice.</p></li>   <li><p>I'm not a huge fan of problems like B where coming up with the general construction is relatively immediate and so the main challenge of the problem comes from working out implementation details (in my case, avoiding off-by-one errors of various sorts). I recognize that this is a personal preference, and I don't view it as an objective failure of the contest (and I certainly would not have downvoted the round just on the basis of this problem).</p></li>   <li><p>My impression is that the FST rate for this contest was somewhat higher than average. This is obviously a topic of active debate, but I think contest authors should do their best to set strong pretests; I can't think of any particularly compelling reason that failing a test excluded from pretests should be penalized more severely than failing a pretest, and thus, it seems most fair to me to try to make pretests strong enough to reject every incorrect solution. That said, the number of FSTs wasn't vastly higher than other recent rounds, so I don't see this as a critical flaw in the contest.</p></li> </ol><p>None of the above three issues are significant enough to lead me to downvote a round, though I can understand why people who FSTed or who took constant factor TLEs on C would downvote.</p><p>Now that I've gone over my criticisms of the round, I should note that I actually liked most of the ideas behind the problems in the contest. D1C-E were good problems, barring the TL issues in C and D, and I liked D2B and D1A/D2C as problems that are quick for those who can solve them easily and need to move on to the rest of the round but interesting for those working at the D2B/C level. This contest had its share of preparation issues, and my hope is that future authors will be careful to avoid these sorts of problems (preparing a contest is challenging, particularly when one tight TL can ruin an otherwise good round for anyone it affects!), but I do hope that the authors will continue to propose problem ideas.</p><p>As an aside, I think that the proposed theory that the downvotes were caused by the timing of the round is highly implausible. The contest had several hundred upvotes prior to the round, suggesting that the contest was downvoted retroactively by participants, not in advance by people unhappy with the timing. I don't see the difficulty balance in Div. 2 as a valid reason to downvote the round--creating a balanced contest with only six problems is remarkably difficult, and I don't think this round was remarkably unbalanced. (I find the theories that people were frustrated by Div. 2 A for various reasons or that those who FSTed downvoted the round somewhat more plausible, and the latter theory is consistent with the strong association between FST rates and downvotes.)</p></div>"}, {"rating": 53, "commentatorHandle": "allvik", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p><strong><font color=\"red\" size=\"2\">300iq</font></strong> loses raiting -&gt; downvotes come</p></div>"}, {"rating": 76, "commentatorHandle": "Vercingetorix", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>I kind of agree with the points about B and D, but not so much about C.

The DSU stores collections of indices which are known to have the same value (these components are always segments) as well as a pointer to the next position that is known to be in a different component.

Basic idea is to find out the earliest timestamp the status of each index becomes determined. First, process all t = 0 &amp;&amp; x = 0 queries. Record the first time each index becomes 0. Maintain a segment tree with point update min. Second, process all t = 0 &amp;&amp; x = 1 queries. We know that for a query with l and r, if and only if there are r-l 0 indices inside it, the left one is determined to be 1. So query the previous segment tree for range sum could find out this. Notice also need to find out the largest timestamp of all 0 indices. The maximum of 0 indices and this 1 query is the timestamp of this 1 index. Notice that, there might be more than 1 queries making this index determined, and we need to pick the minimum one. Last, process all t = 1 queries. if the index has determined status, and the timestamp is earlier than the query, then result is YES or NO, otherwise N/A.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 67, "commentatorHandle": "Rebelz", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>d1D can be solved in $$$O(\\frac{n^2m}{\\omega})$$$ using bitset.</p><p>d1E can be solved in $$$O(n^2)$$$ using Ofast.</p><p>Great contest!</p></div>"}, {"rating": 10, "commentatorHandle": "BARBARIANNNNN", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>I am a idiot.

The input I used makes your program run in 10 s on custom invocation. There is no fundamental difference between C++14 and C++17, unordered set is hackable on all versions, just with slightly different input.</p><p>Here is the hack</p> <pre><code>n = 3 * 10**5\nsize = 25001\np = 30727 \nprint(1)\nprint(n)\nprint(*[p * ((i % size) + 1) for i in range(n)])\n</code></pre><p>There is <a href=\"https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62393\">a well known blog about hacking unordered sets in C++</a>. The short explanation is that unordered sets are very primitive. The way that unordered sets hash an integer $$$i$$$ is that they calculate $$$i \\% p$$$ for some fixed prime $$$p$$$. So all I needed to do to hack your submission is to figure out which prime is being used, and then just make the input multiplies of that prime.</p><p>Unordered sets pick which prime to use from this <a href=\"https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/5bea0e90e58d971cf3e67f784a116d81a20b927a/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/src/shared/hashtable-aux.cc\">list</a>. The way it works is that the unordered set initially picks some small prime, and then as the size of the unordered set grows, it switches to picking larger and larger primes.</p><p>I belive the reason that C++14 and C++17 are different is because they pick primes in a slightly different way (from what I understand this depends on the version of gcc). But importantly both versions still pick primes from the same list depending on the size of the unordered set.</p><p>So to hack your submission I first decided on some size. I arbitrarily used $$$25001$$$. Then to find which prime is used for a $$$25001$$$ sized unordered set, I went through the list of primes $$$p$$$, then I tried making the input $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$ integers consisting of $$$25001$$$ different multiplies of $$$p$$$, and checked if your submission TLEd. It TLEd for $$$p = 30727$$$.

How a bloody facist he is!</p><p>How do the f**king things make sense?</p><p>And as I'm not a Christian I have to say that in my view a war is not the worst political action that a regime can take. It's just like beating a person is sometimes considered not more evil than raping a person. What Russia did is beating Ukraine, what NATO and the US did is raping Russia. Especially in past 20 years wars are not rarely seen in the world (But nobody cares, they only care about today Russia invades Ukraine. How double-standard.). Let alone the current millitary action hasn't killed any plain folk (even till now), and the number of soldiers died even hasn't exceeded the number of people died in east Ukraine before Russian army acts.</p><p>I'm really not saying that it's not Russia's fault. But the US and NATO have their fault before Russia has its fault. The US and NATO are the really the war-makers. They provoke conflicts everywhere to satisfy their benifit, ignoring consequences of doing so. I don't know how will you feel if one day the US drive its army to your nation's border, give sanctions everyday and demonize your country and interfere your country's internal affairs. That's once again my idea: people give sympathy on Ukraine, but they don't give sympath on Afghanistan, Iran, Cuba, Russia and North Korea.</p><p>It seems that Russia is the one to bully Ukraine. But sorry, it's not. Russia is the one to be bullied by NATO and the US. Ukraine relies on NATO and the US. At least before Thursday this is the fact: facing NATO and the US, Russia is the weaker one.</p><p>Will you believe what your media tells you? Russia is an evil country that invades innocent Ukraine? Have you noticed that the US and the Europe decided not to use their millitary force, instead only watching the war going on and give sanctions to Russia? They don't use their millitary because they don't want to help Ukraine. They think Ukraine is not worth helping. They give sanctions to Russia just because they find a new excuse to strike Russia. Western politicians know more than people under this blog: Justice is a concept defined by themselves.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 20, "commentatorHandle": "MrDindows", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><blockquote>   <blockquote><p>Let alone the current millitary action hasn't killed any plain folk (even till now)</p>   </blockquote> </blockquote><p>What moon did you fall from?

It's not made to change you radically the moment you see it. Heck, it might not even be meant to change you. Merely silencing the opponents and making them wonder, even for a second, if they are right is a huge achievement.</p><p>I have a question. Can you define, in concise terms, what constitutes as propaganda? Any political (or sometimes apolitical) statement can be equally regarded as propaganda. Can you prove the good will of the president of the US? Probably not. Can you disprove every conspiracy theory you see? No. So how can you assume one is clearly propaganda or whatever and take the other one at face value?

There are hundreds of people getting high 6/7 figures salaries to think 9to5 or more of exactly this type of situation, have wayyy more information than all of this thread combined, and can make much better decisions as a result.</p><p>Criticizing a government is justified here, but we all should accept that the stakes are high: WW3 and total earth destruction are not impossible in case of a single bad decision. It's easy to blame everything on the US for being too selfish, while ignoring the fact that there aren't too many options on the table right now.</p><p>Thus sticking with sanctions only for now doesn't seem that unreasonable of a decision to make. Plus, you shouldn't underestimate the effects sanctions have. It shouldn't come as a surprise that people tend to start a revolution whenever they fear all they have achieved over many years is going to vanish in a short amount of time (This statement didn't came out of the blue.

He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.</p><p>Strategy</p><p>His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.</p><p>The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.</p><p>A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.</p><p>The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.</p><p>However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.</p><p>Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.</p><p>It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.</p><p>In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.</p><p>Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.</p><p>When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.</p><p>Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.</p><p>Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.</p><p>If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.</p><p>For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.</p><p>For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.</p><p>They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider\u2019s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.</p><p>The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.</p><p>A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted</p><p>A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.</p><p>This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.</p><p>The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.</p><p>A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.</p><p>Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.</p><p>The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.</p><p>A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.</p><p>A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough</p></div></div></div>"}, {"rating": 15, "commentatorHandle": "Ryuk10", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>When will they unfreeze the scoreboard \u2565\ufe4f\u2565</p></div>"}, {"rating": 41, "commentatorHandle": "mango_lassi", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Why does it have to take so long to reveal the results? :(</p><p>We repeatedly took the task with maximum &quot;score upon completion&quot; / &quot;total hours needed to complete&quot;.

China is a strong nation that has just won all four top spots at IOI.</p><p>As you've mentioned, there are also people living in Taiwan. Please understand that these people also don't want to be attacked or subjugated. When you make your point that &quot;China has the confidence to beat anyone&quot;, that understandably gets people very worried.</p><p>As far as the legal status is concerned, the PRC has never had control over Taiwan. In fact, the ROC has even been established (1947) before the PRC has been established (1949). So the claim that ROC is part of PRC has the same legal basis as the claim that PRC is now part of ROC, both claims are equally baseless. Today, Taiwan is a self-determined country and the people of Taiwan, in their democratic system, decide on their own future. China and Taiwan have the option to unite, but only if both parties want to, not due to coercion by military force. The UN charta expressly forbids any acts of aggression against any state, no matter whether that state currently is a UN member (and the fact that this law has not always been followed in different contexts does not give anyone a right to break it, just like watching somebody else getting robbed or even getting robbed yourself does not make it any less evil if in a different situation you are going to stab someone).</p><p>You made a point about historical origins. The people of Austria are also closely linked to the people of Germany in their history, language and culture. These areas have been part of the same empire I think for roughly 90% of the past millennium. But does that give Germany any right today to exert control over Austria or to establish some kind of greater Germany? If you know anything about history, then you must know that that would be an incredibly terrible idea. </p><p>You can disagree with any of that and it might be important to have such an exchange. Only the common understanding must always be that it is never acceptable to use violence for political achievements. Political conflicts must be resolved in a peaceful way, through negotiations or for example through the system of international courts. The rights of every person, in particular the right to live, must always be respected. This very thoughtful post makes exactly that point, urging us all to find a way to get along peacefully in this world:</p> <blockquote><p>War is war, no matter what excuse, it will hurt people badly.

It's translated by &quot;Google Translate&quot;.</p><p>It is not easy to accurately describe the history of modern China, but I don't think it is a waste of time, on the contrary, it is a communication of Chinese culture.</p><p>The Kuomintang was founded in 1894. In the past, it was led by Sun Yat-sen. It was established in the United States. However, due to feudal forces, China was still in chaos in 1926. The warlords were separated. President, started massacres of communists. This history is not a compilation. If you are interested, you can use it to check the &quot;4.12 Counter-Revolutionary Coup&quot;. After that, the Chinese Communist Party has been fighting, and it was not until Japan's full-scale invasion of China that they reached a consensus. Note that Japan In 1931, it invaded the three northeastern provinces of China, which was twice the size of Germany. At this time, the Kuomintang did not resist, but asked Japan for weapons and demanded to destroy the Communist Party first.</p><p>Japan started a full-scale invasion of China in 1937, and the Anti-Japanese War ended in 1945. You must know that in the end, it was only because of the support of the Soviet Union and the atomic bomb of the United States that Japan was defeated. At that time, China was really at a disadvantage, and the &quot;Southern Anhui Incident&quot; in 1941 died. Thousands of people, the Kuomintang who slaughtered the Communists, beat their own people.</p><p>In the final confrontation between the North and the South, the Communist Party won the hearts of the people. In the early stage, 200,000 soldiers fought against 700,000 soldiers. In the later period, it became more than one million against hundreds of thousands. In the end, the remaining members of the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan. The Kuomintang is China. Although it was established in the United States, I would like to ask where is the legal effect of the Kuomintang? Isn't a political party called a political party if it is not supported by the Chinese people? So why don't people recognize the choice of the Chinese people?

China and Russia are really famous for it, as their entire political system is built over it, but not just them. USA does it too. My country, South Korea, has done it against North Korea in the past, and against Japan in recent time. It's really easy for people who aren't aware of it to fall for it, as it's one of our primal instinct.</p><p>There are no single entity of &quot;bad USA&quot; that acts as a source of evil. Neither are &quot;bad China&quot; or &quot;bad Russia&quot;. It's just some political leaders making decisions, and China and Russia are prone to be mentioned a lot as they have been ruled by the same leaders for very long times, and these leaders act like a god itself, ruling above all human rights and their own laws.</p><p>Most of the world are currently supporting Ukraine due to humanatarian crisis caused by the war, and you should stop using it as a tool to spread Putin's propaganda.
