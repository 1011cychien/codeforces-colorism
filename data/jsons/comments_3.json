Use meet in the middle: consider computing, for each vertex, the shortest path with $$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$$ or $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{K}{2} \\right\\rceil$$$ edges from vertex $$$1$$$ and to vertex $$$n$$$, respectively, so that each answer can be found in $$$O(n)$$$ time afterwards by enumerating the middle vertex. These two tasks are similar, so let's just consider the first one (finding shortest paths from vertex $$$1$$$). Note that we now only have to worry about paths of length up to $$$4$$$. There are several possible approaches from here. Here's the one I used:</p><p>We keep track of $$$f(i, j)$$$, the length of the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex $$$i$$$ of length $$$j$$$ ($$$j \\le 4$$$), and $$$g(i, j)$$$, the length of the shortest path from vertex $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ of length 2. When adding an edge $$$u \\to v$$$, first update $$$g$$$ in $$$O(n)$$$ time by going over which edge precedes or follows the edge just added. Then:</p> <ul>   <li>If $$$u \\neq 1$$$: Updating $$$f(x, 1)$$$ and $$$f(x, 2)$$$ is trivial. For updating $$$f(x, 3)$$$, either the added edge is the second edge in the shortest path (in which case we enumerate the next edge in $$$O(n)$$$ time), or the third edge (in which case we update using $$$f(u, 2)$$$). For $$$f(x, 4)$$$, either the added edge is the fourth edge in the shortest path (in which case we update using $$$f(u, 3)$$$), or the second or third edge (in which case we know the middle vertex $$$k$$$ of the 4-edge path, so we can update $$$f(x, 4)$$$ in constant time for each $$$x$$$ using $$$g(1, k)$$$ and $$$g(k, x)$$$). These updates take $$$O(n)$$$ time.</li>   <li>If $$$u = 1$$$: We recalculate $$$f$$$ from scratch using the obvious $$$O(n^2)$$$ algorithm.</li> </ul><p>Since there are $$$O(n^2)$$$ edges of the first kind and $$$O(n)$$$ edges of the second, and extracting the final answer from the two &quot;halves&quot; takes $$$O(n)$$$ time per query, the final complexity is $$$O(n^3)$$$.</p></div></div> <div class=\"spoiler\"><b class=\"spoiler-title\">Problem 2</b><div class=\"spoiler-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Interpret the problem as a graph with cows as vertices and friendships as edges.</p><p><strong>Main Lemma:</strong> Two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ will become friends at some point iff there exists a path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ such that the ID of all vertices on the path (except endpoints) is less than $$$\\min(u, v)$$$.</p><p><em>Proof:</em> Suppose such a path exists. Note that all the non-endpoint vertices on the path will be deleted before either $$$u$$$ or $$$v$$$ is. Consider the deletion of a single vertex $$$w$$$. If $$$w$$$ is not on the path, the path remains valid. If $$$w$$$ is on the path, after deleting it the two vertices adjacent to $$$w$$$ on the path are now adjacent, so $$$w$$$ can be deleted from the path while keeping the path valid, shrinking its length by 1. Eventually, after every internal vertex on the path is deleted, the path would reach a length of 1, i.e. become a direct edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, as desired.</p><p>Conversely, suppose no such path exists. Then after deleting a vertex with ID less than $$$\\min(u, v)$$$, no new path satisfying the condition could possibly be formed (since the deletion only lets us bypass a low-ID vertex, but we need to bypass high-ID vertices to form such a path). Ultimately, vertex $$$\\min(u, v)$$$ will be deleted, with no path satisfying the condition (and therefore no direct edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$) ever existing. $$$\\square$$$</p><p>Now, for each $$$u$$$, we will count the number, $$$f(u)$$$, of $$$v &gt; u$$$ such that the edge $$$(u, v)$$$ will eventually be formed; subtracting $$$m$$$ from the sum of this quantity over all $$$u$$$ gives the final answer. To do that, insert the vertices into the graph one by one by increasing order of ID. For each connected component, maintain the set of vertices adjacent to the component that has not been inserted into the graph yet, using, say, <code>std::set</code> (note that after inserting the first $$$u$$$ vertices, $$$f(u)$$$ is just the number of elements in the set for the connected component $$$u$$$ belongs in). Using small-to-large merging on these sets, the problem can be solved in $$$O(n \\log^2 n)$$$ time.</p></div></div> <div class=\"spoiler\"><b class=\"spoiler-title\">Problem 3</b><div class=\"spoiler-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Consider a single interval for which we want to compute the number of swaps needed.</p><p>Suppose that there are an even number of H's in it. Then the first H will be paired up with the last H, the second with the second-to-last, and so on. To align the first pair of H's, the number of swaps needed is twice the distance between the midpoint of the two H's and the midpoint of the whole interval (taking &quot;half-positions&quot; into account). The answer for the interval is just the sum over all pairs of H's. The case for an odd number of H's is similar, except that there is also a middle H to deal with and that it is possible that the task is impossible if the length of the interval is even.</p><p>Let's calculate the contribution of the intervals with an even number of H's. Enumerate the middle pair (of adjacent H's) and expand outward, one pair of H's at a time. Then, for a fixed set of pairs, the number of swaps is a function of the midpoint of the interval, and it is a piecewise linear function (sum of absolute value functions, one per pair), which can be maintained with Fenwick tree. Then for each interval corresponding to this set of pairs, we can evaluate this function at the midpoint in $$$O(\\log n)$$$ time. The total complexity is $$$O(n^2 \\log n)$$$ since each interval is processed once.</p><p>Handling the intervals with an odd number of H's is similar, but we enumerate the center H instead of the center pair, and we also have to check for each interval whether the task is possible.</p></div></div></div>"}, {"rating": 94, "commentatorHandle": "Perpetually_Purple", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Congrats, enjoy 1 rated contest per month from now on.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 31, "commentatorHandle": "tfg", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Solve problems without looking at their rating, as problem rating doesn't mean much.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 32, "commentatorHandle": "Sol1", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Great job!</p><p>However, don't get frustrated if you drop right back to purple after the next div1 \u2014 that's not your skill problem.

A little disclaimer: My asymptotic running time is worse than what you can get with MITM, but is in my opinion simpler. I did not invent this solution, it is well known in the field of parameterized complexity. Step one is to reduce the problem to vertex cover in a small graph (a graph with at most m-1&lt;=39 vertices). This is the same as other solutions I presume.</p><p>I'll use O* notation in this explanation, which is the same as big O, except polynomial factors are ignored. I'll also use V to denote the number of vertices in the graph, and E to denote the number of edges.</p><p>A simple O*(2^V) solution would be to try all subsets and see if they are vertex covers. Optimizing this using meet in the middle is what i presume is the most common way to solve this problem. The solution described in this comment is based on a different O*(2^V) solution:</p><p>Look at a single edge. At least one of the endpoints of this edge has to be removed. Just trying both leads to a branching tree with O(2^V) vertices, so the running time of this is also O*(2^V).</p><p>A simple improvement to this solution is to instead of looking at a single edge, look at a vertex and its neighborhood. If you don't remove a vertex, then all its neighbors must be removed. So if you branch on the choice between removing a vertex and its neighborhood, it should be faster if the neighborhood is big, since you remove more vertices. But what if we can't find a vertex with big neighborhood? If all vertices have degree 0 or 1, then we just have isolated vertices and isolated edges, which is an easy special case. Otherwise we have get the following recurrence relations for the number of vertices in the branching tree:</p> <center>$$$T[V] \\leq T[V-1] + T[V-2]$$$</center><p>and solving this result in</p> <center>$$$T[V] \\in O(1.6181^V)$$$</center><p>Which is fast enough to solve the problem (yes this is the golden ratio (rounded up) :)).</p><p>Here is a submission: <a href=\"/contest/1767/submission/185546658\" title=\"\u041f\u043e\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430 185546658 \u043e\u0442 magnus.hegdahl\">185546658</a>.</p><p>Some extra notes: I also got accepted without any special case for small max degree: <a href=\"/contest/1767/submission/185542957\" title=\"\u041f\u043e\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430 185542957 \u043e\u0442 magnus.hegdahl\">185542957</a>. Possibly due to bad tests, but I think also picking highest degree vertex alone could be a good enough rule for this problem, because of the way the graph is constructed. The worst case for such a solution would be a set of disjoint edges, but the graph is connected. Creating a graph which reduces to a set of disjoint edges after a few removals wastes too many vertices by having too high degree.</p><p>Better asymptotic running time is possible using a more general base case. A graph where all degrees are smaller than or equal to 2 is a set of disjoint vertices, paths, and cycles, which is also easy to solve in polynomial time, so in the branching we can assume degree 3 or more and get</p> <center>$$$T[V] \\leq T[V-1] + T[V-3]$$$</center><p>which solves to</p> <center>$$$T[V] \\in O(1.4656^V)$$$</center><p>which is still worse than the O(1.4143^V) you can get using MITM and convolutions.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 40, "commentatorHandle": "satyam343", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>On the other hand, I don't think it is an issue if the problems are not arranged in sorted order of difficulty in the Educational rounds, as all problems have the same points.

Why? If the pretests are strong, there is more incentive to just try until you pass the tests. You still do get the $$$-50$$$ for every wrong submission, but there is less incetntive to try to prove that your logic is correct. With weaker pretests, you will have to verify that your solution always works to minimize the risk of getting hacked or FST. I also believe that having to prove that the solution works will make everyone a better problem solver</p><p>In today's round, the pretests of B were very weak. As controvertial as it is, I don't actally think they were bescessarily too weak. Yes, they definitely were on the weaker side, but personally I think that the pretests of other problems are in general just too strong.</p><p>But there is a different issue that arises with very weak pretests: Hacking. For example today, the winner of the contest was decided by the amount of hacks #1 and #2 made. #1 was able to make 17 succesful hacks while #2 only made 11 succesful hacks. #2 would've had around 200 more points than #1 if no hacks were made at all. Why is this unfair? The amount of hacks you were able to make was almost completely based on the amount of pretests passed, but incorrect submissions for B. This was completely down to luck, since you couldn't affect which people you were in a room with. I think we need to change the way hacks give bonus points to people. I have seen some suggestions for formulas calculating how much score you should gain from hacks. My formula is a little different, but the main idea is the same: If you make a lot of succesful hacks, the later ones should give less score boost.</p><p>My suggestion is the following: Every unsuccesful hack is $$$-50$$$:</p><p>The first succesful hack <strong>for every problem</strong> is $$$+100$$$</p><p>The second succesful hack is <strong>for every problem</strong> is $$$+100/2 = +50$$$</p><p>The third succesful hack is <strong>for every problem</strong> is $$$+100/3 = +33$$$</p><p>The fourth succesful hack is <strong>for every problem</strong> is $$$+100/4 = +25$$$</p><p>The fifth succesful hack is <strong>for every problem</strong> is $$$+100/5 = +20$$$</p><p>And so on...</p><p>So, suppose you made three succesful hacks in problem B and one succesful hack in problem C. You also made one unsuccesful hack in problem B. Your hacking score would be $$$100 + 50 + 33 + 100 - 50 = 233$$$ points.</p><p>If you made 15 succesful hacks in the same problem, your score would be $$$332$$$ points (assuming all values were rounded to the nearest integer before the addition).</p><p>UPD: If we decide to keep having strong pretests, I am not completely against that.

We know that this reduces to largest cycle decomposition, with no intersections, as having two intersecting cycles implies there is larger cycle that contains both. Or in essence, the sum of sizes of all distinct largest cycles of each node is $$$n$$$. Therefore we can require it to be printed alongside the input when hacking. You can set up the problem to be interactive, to allow extra input in the hack alongside the input data. </p><p>It would be interesting to have the hack format only available when you solve the problem, because it may serve as too large a hint to the solution.</p><p>To verify the correctness of the largest cycle decomposition, you can iterate over all cycles in decreasing order of size. Notice that when you remove the largest cycle, no remaining connected component can have more than 2 edges towards the cycle, as that would imply there exists a strictly larger cycle. Now this implies there is no other cycle going through the largest cycle, so you can simply delete it, and look at the next largest cycle, independent of the nodes and edges of the largest cycle. This amortizes to $$$O(n\\log{n})$$$ when implemented using a DSU with roll backs and a map.</p><p>For the future, I would recommend all problem-setters to disallow hacking, or either only allow a subset of cases in hacks.

Unfortunately we saw how not to do it in the Huawei contest in September, where the final testcases were too different from the initial ones and some solutions failed with TLE or MLE.</p><p>That leads me to the second point: provide is a local tester (with testcase generator) so participants can test offline. Topcoder gives you a Java application with a visualizer, atCoder has a webpage from where you can download testcases and upload your solution to analyze step by step.</p><p>The alternative (no system testing) will result in a lot of submits with almost identical code and some testcase detection to decide which features or random seed to use to make the submission score higher without actually having a better solution.</p><p>Another point is relative scoring (relative to other contestants or to some upper bound). If the possible score per testcase differs too much, some testcases would just become irrelevant. Topcoder does relative scoring to the highest scoring submission on a testcase. While I think that's the best way to handle it in order to evaluate the strength of different solutions, it might confuse newcomers (your own score can drop, when someone else submits a better solution). AtCoder uses some upper bound and normalizes to it (every testcase could give 100k points in theory, although not always possible in reality \u2014 just a rough estimation).</p></div>"}, {"rating": -42, "commentatorHandle": "actual_truthseeker", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>yes bots are allowed on codeforces. most entries in contests are bots, you can see this since there never are as many comments on posts as there are entries in contests.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 36, "commentatorHandle": "MikeMirzayanov", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>No, but we have huge experience developing such codes for Russian AI Cup contests.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 75, "commentatorHandle": "Psyho", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>It's not that difficult and as <a class=\"rated-user user-blue\" href=\"/profile/eulerscheZahl\" title=\"Expert eulerscheZahl\">eulerscheZahl</a> mentioned, most of the infrastructure is already here. Honestly, I agree with everything that he said and I have no clue why he's being downvoted. Most of the things I'm going to say are more or less the same, just using different words.</p><p>In general, I'd say there are only two good ways of designing heuristic contests:</p><p>1) Same as Topcoder &amp; AtCoder does: every problem needs an official test generator that is available for download (with source code included). You need a &quot;system phase&quot; as well, where you run all of the final solutions against a large hidden test set. This solves the overfitting problem and makes the contest fair at the same time.</p><p>2) Alternative is to give away all of the testcases for download and contestants only submit the answers. There's a version of submitting code instead of output only, but this usually devolves into a contest of compressing your output into the solution. It's fun to do that every once in a while, but it gets boring very quickly.</p><p>I would generally discourage from (2) as I don't think such design is good for building community and it's generally not very educational as there's no mandatory code sharing. There's also no incentive for submitting your solutions, which makes the contest way less exciting. It also gives major advantage to people with access to a lot of computing power. The main upside is that, it's easier to setup such contests and that you don't need to care about support different language etc. Since CF already has all of the important components, I really don't see any reason to do such contests.</p><p>As for (1), you already had a contest meeting all of those criteria: <a href=\"https://codeforces.com/contest/636\">https://codeforces.com/contest/636</a></p><p>I remember that after the contest I gave feedback to <a class=\"rated-user user-orange\" href=\"/profile/Gassa\" title=\"International Master Gassa\">Gassa</a> (who coordinated the contest) about things that could be improved. I can check them later and give a tl;dr. But based on what I remember, most of them were small issues.</p><p>That being said, in order to have good quality heuristic contests you need:</p> <ul>   <li><p>Good problem editor &amp; problem testers. Designing good heuristic (and bot) contests is very similar to designing games. The goal is to create something that has very simple rules, but it has a lot of depth. Recent Huawei matches were complete opposite of this. Bonus if it looks cool and you can make a nice visualizer. Topcoder has dimkadimon, AtCoder has wata and both of them are doing great job. Note that I'd be mostly concerned with the editor/coordinator role. From my experience, a lot of people have great ideas for contests, but it takes experience to turn great idea into a great problem.</p></li>   <li><p>Problem visualizer. Not a strict requirement, but this is what makes those contest fun. Not every contest needs a visualizer though. In theory, community can build visualizers as well and share them. The downside (other than having an official visualizer) is that in such situations it's tricky to design exact rules for competitors. Topcoder (and I think Atcoder as well) have very strict rules about no possible cooperation, code sharing or even talking about results on specific testcases while the contest is active.</p></li> </ul><p>I'm happy to talk more about this if you're interested.

When performing BFS, we only concerned about how far we've step on these two chains. So, a ideal DP state appears: $$$f(u,v)$$$ representing the probability that the event &quot;$$$u$$$ (on the left-most chain) occurs and $$$v$$$ (on the right-most chain) occurs, but $$$2u,2v+1$$$ don't&quot; happens. Transformation is also apparent, $$$f(2u,v)\\overset{+}{\\longleftarrow}pf(u,v)$$$ and $$$f(u,2v+1)\\overset{+}{\\longleftarrow}(1-p)f(u,v)$$$, where $$$p$$$ is the probability that &quot;when $$$u,v$$$ occur in a queue but $$$2u,2v+1$$$ don't, $$$2u$$$ occurs first during the subsequent BFS processing&quot;.</p><p>\u2003\u2003Our last task is to find $$$p$$$.

We know that $$$p_{2u}=\\min S$$$ and $$$p_{2v+1}=\\min T$$$, so the key is where $$$x=\\min U$$$ goes!

And use PIE to get the actual answer.</p><p>Focus on a single value of $$$y'$$$. $$$A_1|A_2|A_3|\\ldots|A_n \\subseteq y'$$$ can be represented as $$$A_i \\subseteq y'$$$. Let $$$C$$$ be the array of toggled bits in $$$y'$$$ copied $$$n$$$ times. Then we can represent this as finding the parity of the number of solutions to $$$\\sum B_i \\cdot 2^{C_i}=x$$$, where $$$B_i$$$ can be chosen to be either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. This is for because each bit inside $$$y'$$$, we have a choice to turn it on or off for elements of $$$A$$$. And we want to count the number of such ways to do that, which leads to us solving the above problem. This is a giant subset sum problem that is not feasible to solve, so let us instead try to make some observations about it.</p><p>Suppose that $$$C_a=C_b$$$, then we will perform the operation $$$\\text{swap}(B_a,B_b)$$$. This operation is an <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/4z3uj4je\">involution</a> over all solutions to $$$B$$$. The parity of the number of solutions is equivalent to the parity of the number of fixed points of the involution.</p> <div class=\"spoiler\"><b class=\"spoiler-title\">elaboration</b><div class=\"spoiler-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Consider the solutions of $$$B$$$ as vertices of a graph. We will add a directed edge from solution $$$B_1$$$ to $$$B_2$$$ if $$$B_2$$$ is obtained by swapping $$$B_{1,a}$$$ and $$$B_{1,b}$$$. Now, each vertex has exactly $$$1$$$ outgoing edge.</p><p>Notice that if we traverse the edges twice, we will end up back at the same vertex since swapping $$$B_a$$$ and $$$B_b$$$ twice does nothing. Therefore, each connected component of the graph either looks like $$$a$$$ with a self-loop to itself or $$$a \\leftrightarrow b$$$.</p><p>If we delete all connected components of the form $$$a \\leftrightarrow b$$$, the parity of the number of vertices does not change since we deleted an even number of vertices.

The content might be dense, but it tries to tie together concepts that are treated in a much more rigorous sense elsewhere, and it is easy to get lost in the content. Understanding the connections tends to be more important than the contents themselves for complex topics (this is also part of the reason why &quot;meta&quot; things like category theory exist in the first place).</li>   <li>The blog doesn't just talk about martingales, it treats it as a nice topic in probability theory that deserves some attention for itself. The main motivation behind writing the blog was to inform people of a mathematically &quot;correct&quot; way of thinking about probability and random processes that you can build some intuition around. Looking at the concepts structurally is how the blog goes around explaining probability, and though not all of the ideas developed will be useful for martingales directly, all of them are important in developing the relevant understanding of probability in general from a bottom-up perspective.</li>   <li><p>The problem solving mentioned in the topic deals with math Olympiad and competitive programming problems -- it won't be necessarily applicable in real life situations in the form it is explained. Real life applications usually involve stochastic calculus where these concepts need some more rigour to be made precise, and they fit very neatly into that theory. However, the point of my blog was to show applications in more discrete settings. In fact, the blog was written with the idea that this theory wasn't developed just for formalizing probability \u2014 rather, it is a clear way of thinking that makes you understand probability from another perspective, and naturally leads to things like random processes.</p></li>   <li><p>Sigma algebras naturally arise from the definition of probability. They're just a triple of two related sets and a function, so if you follow along the blog with some attention and pen and paper (yes, I'm aware that the blog is dense in quite some parts), it shouldn't be hard to grasp the main ideas. Having some working knowledge of set operations is pretty much the only prerequisite. The point is, don't be afraid of mathematical objects. Work out some examples and get a feel of the operations and structures involved.</p></li>   <li><p>Again, sigma algebras arise naturally as a representation of all possible information you have about a set. In the context of processes, more refined sigma algebras correspond to having more progress in the process (because you can roughly reason about more possibilities). I don't know of a more intuitive (and correct) way of reasoning about processes generally. Reading the section on martingales will help understand why the sigma algebra formalism is so important.</p></li> </ul><p>The bottom line is that it might take a couple of readings to completely understand the presentation of topics, and the reason why they were presented in the order they were. Perhaps looking at the problems and explanations of the significance theorems might help in understanding the underlying ideas more concretely. Also, the context in which you might know martingales may be very different from what the blog covers. The ideas remain the same in both cases \u2014 that abstraction is why math is so important nowadays.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 51, "commentatorHandle": "aymanriadsolh", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>The downvote is probably from the cheater who got notified since you mentioned him lmao</p></div>"}, {"rating": -129, "commentatorHandle": "kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkki", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Nope.

Here are some pieces of advice to help you on your journey:</p> <pre>Build a Strong Foundation:\n    Ensure you have a solid understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms. This includes topics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.\n\nPractice Regularly:\n    Consistent practice is key. Solve a variety of problems on online coding platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, HackerRank, or LeetCode. Gradually increase the difficulty level of the problems as you gain confidence.\n\nParticipate in Contests:\n    Join online coding contests regularly to simulate the competitive environment. This will help you get accustomed to time constraints and improve your problem-solving skills.\n\nAnalyze Solutions:\n    After solving a problem or participating in a contest, analyze the solutions of others, especially those who performed well. Understand different approaches, optimizations, and coding styles.\n\nLearn from Mistakes:\n    Mistakes are part of the learning process. Don't be discouraged by failures. Instead, analyze your mistakes and understand why a particular approach didn't work. This will help you avoid similar errors in the future.\n\nStudy Past IOI Problems:\n    Familiarize yourself with past IOI problems. Understand the types of problems that are commonly featured and the techniques used to solve them. This will give you insight into the level of difficulty and the required skill set.\n\nImprove Your Speed and Accuracy:\n    Work on improving your coding speed without compromising accuracy. Efficient and bug-free code is crucial in a competitive programming setting with time constraints.\n\nExplore Advanced Topics:\n    Once you are comfortable with the basics, start exploring more advanced topics such as geometry, number theory, advanced graph algorithms, and combinatorics. IOI problems often involve a mix of standard and advanced concepts.\n\nParticipate in Virtual Contests:\n    Simulate contest conditions by setting a timer and solving problems in a virtual contest environment. This will help you manage time effectively during actual contests.\n\nStay Persistent and Stay Positive:\n    Success in competitive programming takes time and effort. Stay persistent, be patient, and maintain a positive attitude. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small, and use setbacks as learning opportunities.</pre><p>Remember, the journey is as important as the destination.
