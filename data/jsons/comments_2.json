The point beyond which you'll give up on a problem on average should be longer than for someone say at the 1400 level, because there are lower chances it is something completely new that you don't know already. It's hard to define a number of hours though, very subjective, changes from problem to problem and mostly depends on gut feel.</p><p>When you do read an editorial for a problem you couldn't solve, don't read the full thing in one go. Only read it upto the first point where you see something new that you didn't discover when you were trying to solve it. Stop there, go back to the problem and try to figure out the rest yourself, keep repeating this.

In the second code, the compiler optimizes the code, by placing the new bitset at an offset of ~400k bits.

To find the number of subarrays in a range L, R satisfying the 3rd query, we only need to consider the subarrays having only 1's. This can be solved using segment trees. we just need to make a node to store the number of prefix 1's, suffix 1's, length of the range, and the number of subarrays having only 1's. The main task is to make a merge function for merging the left and right nodes of a segment tree. This would be easy if you are comfortable with segment trees. To solve the 1st query, you only need to assign a particular value to a given range which is a current bit of a given number that can be either 0 or 1.

Test 30 is exactly the <a href=\"https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/101817?locale=en\">anti-hash-table test for Python</a>, which increases the time complexity of finding an element by key from O(1) to O(n). To prevent the Python code from being hacked, commonly people use a custom randomized hash function (the code can be found <a href=\"https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/101817?locale=en\">here</a>). Now about provided solution, in Python hashing of int type always happens in the same way, but str is hashed differently each time the code is run, so it's convenient to just convert int to str. Since the hashing will be different every time, it will be impossible to come up with a test against it.

Therefore, if we add 2 unremovable sellers s[0]=1 and s[m+1]=n+1, the number of cookies will be sum(1&lt;=i&lt;=m+1)(ceil((s[i+1]-s[i])/d)), then we can brute force for every removable seller.</p><p>C: The maximum score is floor(n/2), which means (1, 2, ..., floor(n/2)) can be values of gcd(a[i], a[i+1]), because if t&gt;floor(n/2), then 2*t&gt;n, but if a[i]!=a[i+1] and gcd(a[i], a[i+1])=t, WLOG assume a[i]&lt;a[i+1], then a[i]&gt;=t and a[i+1]&gt;=2*t, which is a contradiction. On the otherside, the permutation (1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 3, 6, 12, ..., 5, 10, ..., 2*k+1, 2*(2*k+1), 4*(2*k+1), ...) can reach this upper bound.</p><p>D: We need to find following values:</p><p>pre[t][i]: the maximum size of consecutive block of '1' in the substring s[1, i] if we can flip at most t values.</p><p>suf[t][i]: the maximum size of consecutive block of '1' in the substring s[i, n] if we can flip at most t values.</p><p>They can be found by two pointers (keeping index i, j and make sure that the number of occurence of '0' in the substring s[i, j] is no more than t). Then for every pair (i, j) such that i&lt;=j, we can take s[i, j] as the maximum consecutive block of '0', let cnt = the occurence of '1' in s[i, j], then L0=j-i+1 and L1=max(pre[k-cnt][i-1], suf[k-cnt][j+1]). We can get a valid pair of (L0, L1) for every pair (i, j), but for each L0 we only need to keep the maximum corresponding L1. Then we can get at most (n+1) different functions f(a)=L0*a+L1, then we can evaluate the maximum values on [1, n] by brute force in O(n*2).</p><p>E1: At first we create a tree with only a root node and no value, and a stack containing this root node. Then we can translate queries like this:</p><p>&quot;+ x&quot;: Create a new node with value x, let the node on the stack top be it's parent. Push this new node into the stack.</p><p>&quot;- k&quot;: Push the k-th ancestor of the node on the stack top into the stack.</p><p>&quot;!&quot;: Pop the top node from the stack.</p><p>&quot;?&quot;: Find the number of distinct values on the path from the root to the node on the stack top.</p><p>Using binary lifting we can find the k-th ancestor in O(log(k)), then we can build the tree and get the list of queried nodes in O(q*log(q)), and using dfs to find the answer for all nodes. Then we can solve the problem offline.</p><p>E2: To solve the problem online, we need to use persistent segment tree to do update and queries on the history version of an array. However, because the low memory limit of this problem, when using 12 bytes (3 int32 variables for value, left child and right child) for a node of segment tree (there can be O(q*log(X_MAX)) = 2e7 nodes in total), I got MLE for several times. But we can make some observation:</p><p>--- Once a tree node has been created, the answer corresponding to this node will not change. So we only need to find answers when doing &quot;+ x&quot; operation.</p><p>--- If value x is on the path from root to the parent of new node, the answer will be increased by 1, otherwise remain the same. So we only need to check the existence of a single value, instead of checking the sum on any certain range.</p><p>Therefore, we only need to keep 2 pointers to left child and right child (we use -1 as null pointer, which means there's no value exists in the subtree), and the space for a single node of segment tree will be 8 bytes, which fit the memory limit.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 59, "commentatorHandle": "CaveVenom1", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>this didn't age well. to be fair, most of the problems were interesting, but B and C were definitely ordered incorrectly</p></div>"}, {"rating": 28, "commentatorHandle": "_aka5h", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Don't</p></div>"}, {"rating": -11, "commentatorHandle": "clocosacide", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>No offense, but have you guys mistook the order of problem B and problem C???</p></div>"}, {"rating": 11, "commentatorHandle": "MOHlT", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>lol today's C was even more easier</p></div>"}, {"rating": 23, "commentatorHandle": "ChaosAngel", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>B is one of those problems that is simple if you have the author's intended implementation in mind and torturous if you don't. </p></div>"}, {"rating": -16, "commentatorHandle": "Miracle_b", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Are you sure you f**king passed English IV?</p></div>"}, {"rating": 11, "commentatorHandle": "Arthas", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>zero balance</p></div>"}, {"rating": 24, "commentatorHandle": "indian_rounds_LULW", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>If someone was wondering why the contest got postponed, that's because the authors were trying to come up with problems B and C in the last 10 minutes (they have failed miserably).</p></div>"}, {"rating": 13, "commentatorHandle": "RestlessPsycho", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Statement for problem B was so bad.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 33, "commentatorHandle": "RDDCCD", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Thank you so much for making E2 interactive instead of xor lastans.</p><p>My online algorithm get TLE on E2 but passed E1, because I thought can not use std::cin and ios::sync_with_stdio(false) in an interactive problem:(</p></div>"}, {"rating": 19, "commentatorHandle": "star_dust1", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Worst Problem B statement I have ever seen.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 10, "commentatorHandle": "RemoveFST", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>B is unclear.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 16, "commentatorHandle": "AndriaBeridze", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Second and third problem should be swapped.

I could imagine using either ~5s or 1s, with 1s intended to clearly cut all solutions that don't optimize out the log factor. Especially because the slower solution requires some optimization to get AC, I don't love that there is also an $$$O(N^2)$$$ solution that seems pretty difficult to prove, since this pretty heavily rewards proofs by AC.</p><p>D: Good problem, probably my favorite of the round. The observation that the containment constraint is helpful is pretty nice and the implementation is fairly straightforward from there. (The bonus task is also nice, and I thought about it in-contest when I didn't read the containment constraint--I could imagine including it as a harder subtask with a score distribution along the lines of 1500 + 2500, but I think excluding it is fine too.)</p><p>E: Good problem; the absolute value maximization trick is a nice one for people who haven't seen it yet.</p><p>I don't understand why my solution gets AC: see <a href=\"https://codeforces.com/contest/1859/submission/218527956\">here</a> for my in-contest solution and <a href=\"https://codeforces.com/contest/1859/submission/218583281\">here</a> for the solution I think is correct. The difference occurs in case 4; I think my current solution maximizes |A[l] \u2014 A[r]| + |B[l] \u2014 B[r]| instead of |A[l] \u2014 B[r]| + |A[r] \u2014 B[l]| when the interval we choose has length greater than one. I have no idea why this passes, but at the same time I don't immediately see a countercase (it's a bit harder because I correctly handle the case where the length of an interval is 1).</p><p>My current theory is that the only two cases we need to actually consider are A[l] + B[l] \u2014 A[r] \u2014 B[r] and A[r] + B[r] \u2014 A[l] \u2014 B[l]; for the other two cases we could do better by splitting into smaller intervals. Indeed, <a href=\"https://codeforces.com/contest/1859/submission/218588913\">this submission</a> only considers these two cases and gets AC. If anyone has a proof of this, I'd be happy to see it; I'll also try to show that this holds myself later on.</p><p>F: Fairly good problem. The implementation was a bit annoying, but that's hard to avoid unless you want to exclude this type of heavy-duty tree problem entirely.</p><p>My one criticism of the statements is that I think &quot;cost&quot; should be replaced with &quot;value&quot; in C and E. Typically, we try to minimize a cost, so when I skimmed the problems and read the word &quot;cost&quot;, I tried to minimize the answers rather than maximizing them for my first few minutes. I think it makes more sense to use cost for minimization problems and value (or e.g. score or similar) for maximization problems.</p><p>Overall, though, I enjoyed the contest--thanks very much to the authors!</p></div>"}, {"rating": 19, "commentatorHandle": "people_plus_plus", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Isn't graph will be too large?

For decades, the Palestinian people have been at the center of a protracted and deeply emotive conflict, seeking to secure their rights to nationhood and sovereignty in their homeland. &quot;Striving for Freedom: The Palestinian Quest for Self-Determination&quot; encapsulates this enduring journey toward political autonomy and the numerous challenges that have defined it.</p><p>The roots of the Palestinian quest for self-determination can be traced back to the early 20th century when the region was under Ottoman rule. The fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the subsequent British Mandate in Palestine laid the foundation for the eventual conflict. Over the years, the Arab and Palestinian demands for national sovereignty grew stronger, but the British Mandate and the Balfour Declaration, which promised a &quot;national home for the Jewish people&quot; in Palestine, further complicated the situation.</p><p>The mid-20th century saw a dramatic escalation of tensions. The 1947 UN Partition Plan aimed to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, which was met with resistance from the Arab world and the Palestinian population. This led to the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, known as the Nakba, or &quot;catastrophe,&quot; which resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The conflict, marked by territorial disputes, violence, and competing nationalisms, continued to evolve.</p><p>The Six-Day War of 1967 further deepened the Palestinian predicament, as Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), led by figures like Yasser Arafat, emerged as a prominent actor in the quest for self-determination. Through armed struggle and diplomacy, the PLO sought international recognition and a resolution to the Palestinian predicament.</p><p>The Oslo Accords of the 1990s represented a turning point in the conflict, as Israel and the PLO formally recognized each other and agreed to a process that would lead to Palestinian self-governance. However, despite hopes for a two-state solution, the path to self-determination remained fraught with obstacles. Ongoing Israeli settlement expansion, security concerns, and political divisions among the Palestinians have hindered progress.</p><p>Today, the Palestinian quest for self-determination persists. It is marked by the struggles of Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and those living in the diaspora, who continue to assert their right to statehood and the return of refugees. International support for a two-state solution remains a point of contention, and regional dynamics in the Middle East continue to influence the course of this enduring conflict.</p><p>&quot;Striving for Freedom: The Palestinian Quest for Self-Determination&quot; encapsulates not only the historical narrative but the hopes, aspirations, and complexities of a deeply rooted and ongoing struggle. The desire for self-determination and statehood remains a central issue in the broader context of peace and stability in the Middle East, making it a topic of global significance and ongoing dialogue.</p> <div class=\"spoiler\"><b class=\"spoiler-title\">free</b><div class=\"spoiler-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>PALESTINE </p></div></div></div>"}, {"rating": -17, "commentatorHandle": "AmmarDab3an", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>In solidarity with the Palestinian people, and because Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/10/metas-efforts-regarding-israel-hamas-war/\">policies and practices</a> to mute our voices ... <strong>I'm not going to participate in Round 2 and any future Meta sponsored competitions</strong> </p><p>If anyone doesn't know what I'm talking about.

Since the first and last character can't be changed, there will be occurence of &quot;01&quot; in both a and b after operation, and they need to occur at the same position, so there must be some position that &quot;01&quot; occurs at this position both in a and b initially. On the other hand, if a[i]=b[i]='0' and a[i+1]=b[i+1]='1', we can do operation (1, i) and (i+1, n) both on a and b, then a and b will be the same.</p><p>C: We need to maintain 2 values: pos1 = the leftest possible position such that a[pos1-1]&gt;a[pos1], pos2 = the maximum possible prefix such that a[1, pos2] is sorted. When we process query '0', we need to check if pos1&lt;=length, then let pos2=length-1, and for '1' we need to check if pos2&gt;=length, then let pos1=inf. </p><p>D: Suppose we need to make a[1, k] negative and a[k+1, n] positive. For making a[k+1, n] positive and sorted, we need a operation for each k+1&lt;=i&lt;n and a[i]&gt;=a[i+1]. For making a[1, k] negative and sorted, we need a operation for each 1&lt;=i&lt;k and a[i]&lt;=a[i+1], then we need an extra operation on [1, k] multiply by -1. Therefore we can solve the problem by keeping prefix and suffix sums.</p><p>E: When solving the problem for a single array, we can solve by greedy: Iterate i from 1 to n, when a[i-k+1, i] is a permutation and doesn't intersect with any subarray we've taken, we take it as a valid subarray. Let dp[i][j] = the answer when we consider arrays of length i and the length of the maximal suffix without duplicate elements is j, cnt[i][j] = number of arrays of length i and the length of the maximal suffix without duplicate elements is j. For 0&lt;=j&lt;k-1, the update is dp[i][t] += dp[i-1][j] for 1&lt;=t&lt;=j, dp[i][j+1] += (k-j)*dp[i-1][j] (similar for cnt[i][t]). When j==k-1, adding the missing number of the suffix with length k-1 will create a new permutation as a subarray, so the answer need to be increased: ans[i][0] += ans[i-1][k-1] + cnt[i-1][k-1], and for 1&lt;=t&lt;k, we have ans[i][t] += ans[i-1][k-1]. Thus we can solve the problem in O(n*k) by using prefix sum for range updates.</p></div>"}, {"rating": 28, "commentatorHandle": "Kumarfeldspar", "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Best contest of my life, Thanks.

Assume starting time is $$$0$$$ (meaning the first imaginary quest which is prerequisite of any other quest was done at day 0, hour 0). Maintain a $$$dp$$$ array, where $$$dp[v]$$$ is the day when the quest $$$v$$$ is completed. It's clear that if the quest has no prerequisite it's $$$dp$$$ value is zero. Otherwise, let $$$u_1,...,u_k$$$ be prerequisites of $$$v$$$, then $$$dp[v] = max(dp[u_i] + f(u_i))$$$ where $$$f(x) = 1$$$ if $$$h[x] &gt; h[v]$$$ and $$$f(x) = 0$$$ otherwise. Answer to the problem is maximum value of $$$dp[v] * k + h[v]$$$ (Since we are counting starting time as $$$0$$$ and $$$v$$$'s quest is done after $$$dp[v]$$$ days on $$$h[v]$$$ hours).  However, we need to choose optimal starting time and somehow maintain the answer. Notice that optimal starting time is some $$$h[i]$$$, where $$$i$$$'s quest has no prerequisite. Assume $$$v_1,...,v_k$$$ are such quests and WLOG assume $$$h[v_1] &lt;= ... &lt;= h[v_k]$$$.
